<h1>About Anton</h1>
<p>Anton spent the SteemFest<sup>2</sup> hackathon in Lisbon
	writing the jquery that powers blockpress.</p>

<h2>Steem blockchain</h2>
<p>They want to use the software as a personal blog that
	uses steem blockchain as a backend. If you press the
	profile button in the menu, you can see the progress
	so far. This profile data is retreived from the blockchain
	with the aid of the <a href="https://github.com/steemit/steem-js">steem javascript library, steem-js</a>.</p>
