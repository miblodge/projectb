<h1>About Blockpress.me</h1>
<p><strong>Blockpress.me</strong> is an entirely front end web program,
  written in java script and jquery. It allows the user to create highly
  customisable and themable websites, that can make use of ajax loading
  content modules to pull data from multiple javascript apis.</p>

<h2>Steem posts</h2>
<p>Our first main content module, which uses the Steem blockchain API, will
allow the webhost to create any site that needs posts and comments, such
as blogs and forums. To test the progress of the module so far, click
the link above for STEEM POSTS. This current loads the latest steem
posts about blockpress by Anton. To read the full post click on any of the
post titles.</p>

<h2>Future Developement</h2>
