<h1>Example Steem Post</h1>

<p>This isn't really a steem post, as this is just a prototype. However
this static content exists in a file that could update with the latest
steem post, perhaps polling via a specific tag.</p>

<p>A more clever projectb module will be added that allows the user
  to specify steem a steem username, tag or specific post id to display,
  and cache the result on request.</p>
