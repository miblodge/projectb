<h1>About Blockpress.me</h1>
<p><strong>Blockpress.me</strong> allows the user to create highly
  customisable and themable websites, that can make use of ajax loading
  content modules to pull data from multiple javascript apis.</p>



<h2>Steem posts</h2>
<p>Our first main content module, which uses the Steem blockchain API, will
allow the webhost to create any site that needs posts and comments, such
as blogs and forums. We use this module to display our news feed.</p>

<h2>Future Developement</h2>
<p>We are currently in beta release and working on lots of important new features. <a href="https://github.com/blockpress/blockpress.me/milestone/2">Keep track of
	our progress</a> on github.</p>
