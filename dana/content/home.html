<h1>About Dana</h1>
<p><a href="https://dana.blockpress.me">Dana</a> came up with the concept of replacing
	WordPress with a system based on the steem blockchain back in 2016. This
	idea lead to them signing up to steem in June 2016, and eventually Anton followed her
	in February 2017. During the <strong>SteemFest<sup>2</sup> hackathon</strong> in Lisbon
	2017 they built four themes for BlockPress to demonstrate the ease of theming the new
	CMS. They have continued to refine these themes as development continues, in particular
	adding responsive design support to the dark theme used on this site. They have also begun
	making contributions to the javascript and jquery code base, and enhancing themes with
jquery features.</p>
