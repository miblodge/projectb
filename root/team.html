<h1>Meet the Blockpress.me team</h1>


<h2>Dana</h2>
<p><strong>Concept and Themes</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://dana.blockpress.me">Dana</a> came up with the concept of replacing
	WordPress with a system based on the steem blockchain back in 2016. This
	idea lead to them signing up to steem in June 2016, and eventually Anton followed her
	in February 2017. During the <strong>SteemFest<sup>2</sup> hackathon</strong> in Lisbon
	2017 they built four themes for BlockPress to demonstrate the ease of theming the new
	CMS. They have continued to refine these themes as development continues, in particular
	adding responsive design support to the dark theme used on this site. They have also begun
	making contributions to the javascript and jquery code base, and enhancing themes with
	jquery features.</p>

<h2>Anton</h2>
<p><strong>Front end development</strong></p>
<p>The technical specification for BlockPress came from <a href="https://anton.blockpress.me">Anton</a>. Whilst Anton
is an experienced full stack developer, they chose to focus on front end design in this project. Reasoning
that since the content is stored on the blockchain, no need for a back end system like php or node.js was needed.
All content could be loaded via ajax and api calls to various blockchain based content making for a smoother
user experience.</p>


<h2>Henrik</h2>
<p><strong>Back end development</strong></p>
<p>Anton and Dana met <a href="https://hkjn.me">Henrik</a> at the hackathon,
and with his backend server skills he quickly proved an invaluable member of the team. He also named the project. By taking
care of of the web server and auto updating content from github he freed Anton to concentrate on coding the front end.</p>
