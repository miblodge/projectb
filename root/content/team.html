<h1>Meet the Blockpress.me team</h1>
<p>Back in 2016 Anton began thinking of integrating the federated social
	network software, Friendica, with WordPress and BuddyPress. However Dana,
	researching other posibilities wondered if it might not be a better idea
	to develop something based on a rather different technology. This lead to
	them joining the steem blockchain and eventually taking their idea to
	the <strong>SteemFest<sup>2</sup> hackathon</strong> in Lisbon 2017, where
	they met Henrik.</p>

<h1>Dana</h1>
<p><strong>Concept and Themes</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://dana.blockpress.me">Dana</a> came up with the concept of
	replacing WordPress with a system based on Steem blockchain technology, which
	gave birth to BlockPress.<p>

<p>Dana creates and improves themes for BlockPress. They demonstrate the ease
	of customising the  CMS and are continually improved with new features such
	as responsive design support and  jQuery.</p>

<h1>Anton</h1>
<p><strong>Front end development</strong></p>
<p>The technical specification for BlockPress came from <a href="https://anton.blockpress.me">Anton</a>.
They built the system up from a JSON config file, customisable theme support, optional content modules,
third party libraries, a tiny quick loading index file and flexible initialisation script using
their knowledge of javascript, jQuery and ajax technologies.</p>


<h1>Henrik</h1>
<p><strong>Back end development</strong></p>
<p>With his backend server skills <a href="https://hkjn.me">Henrik</a> quickly
	proved an invaluable member of the team. He named the project and takes
care of of the web server and auto updating content from github.</p>
