# Blockpress.me
[Blockpress.me](https://blockpress.me) is a javascript/jquery content management system that uses various blockchains for backend storage, loaded via ajax modules. The project began life at the Lisbon Steemfest Hackathon on Nov 1, 2017.

## Example websites showing off different themes
Each of these three example sites using blockpress.me are inspired by the three developers. Each is used as an example of a different use case.

- https://dana.blockpress.me
- https://hkjn.blockpress.me

## Install
To install the alpha version of blockpress, click the 'Clone or download' button, then select 'Download ZIP'. Extract the files and copy the contents of the 'code' directory to your chosen web directory. Copy `config.json` to `local_config.json` and edit the latter to create your personalised site settings. See the [wiki](https://github.com/blockpress/blockpress.me/wiki) for further instructions.

## Server side setup
See also https://github.com/hkjn/blockpress.me, where the server-side setup lives. This pulls data for the blockpress website, and the three example sites, directly from four subfolders in the https://github.com/miblodge/projectb repository.
