<h1>Open source projects</h1>
<p>Anton has built and maintained a number of FLOSS projects over the years,
	including serveral wordpress plugins. Their most recent projects include the
		SteemSwitch firefox plugin and the BlockPress frontend CMS.</p>

<h2>Current projects</h2>
<div><h3>BlockPress</h3>
<p>Anton is developing <a href="https://blockpress.me">BlockPress.me</a> with
	<a href="https://dana.blockpress.me">Dana</a>. BlockPress.me is a FLOSS
	frontend CMS that uses blockchain	content modules as its data. BlockPress
	powers this site and its own website, and is nearing first beta release!</p>
</div>

<div><h3>SteemSwitch</h3>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/steemswitch/">SteemSwitch</a>
	is a Firefox browser plugin that allows the user to switch easily
	between steemit, busy, utopian, steemd, steemdb and other sites based
	on the steem blockchain.</p>
	<p>Anton has a plan to port this code to the Chrome browser at some point in
		the near future.</p>

<h2>Old projects</h2>
<div><h3>Wordpress plugins</h3>
	<p>Anton developed several wordpress plugins, although these are no longer maintained. If anyone
	wishes to fork and maintian them, they should feel welcome to do so.</p>
	<div><h4>bbPress2 shortcode whitelist</h4>
	<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress2-shortcode-whitelist/">bbPress2 shortcode whitelist</a>
	was built to allow a limited selection of wordpress shortcodes to be allowed in comments. It automatically
	detected certain plugins, such as Anton's own bbPress2 BBCode plugin, and his Video and Audio BBcode
	plugin, to allow them to be used. All other wordpress shortcodes are only allowed by the site authors.</p>
	</div>
	<div><h4>bbPress2 BBCode</h4>
	<p><a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress-bbcode/">bbPress2 BBCode</a> was developed in order
		to add support to forum style BBCodes to wordpress posts and comments. Originally he built it for the bbPress2
	 	forum extension project, hence the name, but he soon expanded it to work in regular wordpress posts, comments
		and BuddyPress user profile fields.</p>
	</div>
	<div><h4>Video and Audio BBCodes</h4>
	<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/video-audio-bbcodes/">Video and Audio BBCode</a> added
		support for special video shortcodes for embedding youtube and other videos in WordPress posts and comments. It
		became redundant when WordPress starting embedding them automatically with just a link.</p>
	</div>
	<div><h4>Custom profile filters for BuddyPress</h4>
	<p>Anton developed <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress-bbcode/">Custom profile filters for BuddyPress</a>
		specifically extended BuddyPress user profile pages to allow special fields to be added. If installed in combination
	  with bbPress2 BBCode, it allowed BBCode formatting to be used in profile fields. It also gave users control over which
		words turned into search fields, and allowed special social media link fields for twitter to be added.</p>

<div><h3>Elgg plugins</h3>
	<p>Before WordPress, Anton wrote <a href="https://elgg.org/plugins/search?owner=antonchanning">a few plugins for Elgg</a>.
		Their final plugin was to export all the Elgg data to a wordpress export format XML file. This enabled an easy transition
		from Elgg to BuddyPress.</p>
</div>

<div><h3>EnigMagick</h3>
	<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/enigmagick/">EnigMagick</a> is a simple tool for calculating a numeric value for a given string of text
		and finding words and phrases with a matching value in another piece of text. Themeable. Whilst not very useful in its current form, I had an idea
		to use it to extend to disguise secret messages as strange prose. Only those with the correct 'key' text would be able to decode it correctly.</p>
</div>

<div><h3>ChaosHex</h3>
	<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/chaoshex/">ChaosHex</a> is my only old project not written in PHP. This one was
		instead written using BASH scripts. It is a frivolous demo inspired by ideas like those found in the Martix, that we live
		inside a computer simulation, and can hack the program from within. It was really an excuse to make pretty patterns appear
		on the screen.</p>
